    <h2 id="speedcube">History of Cubes</h2>
<p>In 1974 Erno Rubik made his final prototype Rubik’s Cube. The cube was quite big and made out of wood. After a month Erno Rubik realised he couldn’t actually solve his own creation. In the next 5 years Hungary started to produce Erno's Rubik cubes named "Magic Cubes." In 1980 the name was changed to the "Rubik's Cube" to credit the creater as it made its international debut. The cube was a huge sucess selling 100 million in the first three years. Everyone was trying to figure out how to solve the cube. David Singmaster invented the first layer-by-layer method, a method which is still used today as the most common learner method. In 1997, Jessica Fridrich invented the Fredrich method also knowen as CFOP is the method that most of the fastest speedcubers use today. Today the rubik's cube is over 40 years old and has sold more than 350 million cubes.</p>

    <p>Normal rubik's cubes are slow and require alot of muscle to turn each peice. However Speedcubes are made for speed, they turn very fast and are effetless to turn and control. They almost always have cube lube, which increases speed even more. Speedcubes are made with rounded edges which allow them to corner-cut. The speedcube market really started booming</p>
